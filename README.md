# Start up instructions

Use *separate* terminals for start server and client.

1. Open the server folder and run following commands:
   * npm install
   * npm run server

## json-server will start on port 3000
You can send requests to http://localhost:3000.

2. Open the client folder and run following commands:
   * npm install
   * npm run start

## Angularjs app will start on port 3001
A new browser window should open automatically and take you to http://localhost:3001.
